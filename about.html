        <h1>About - The Mach Club</h1>
        <p>
            The Mach Club is an LDR, Leadership Development Requirements, aka: Club, in Air Force & Navy JROTC and ROTC units.<br><br>
            This club will teach all of the survival skills needed to survive in any conditions. For example, how to fly a plane, what to do when you're stuck in the middle of the ocean, what happens when you're in the middle of an unknown forest and must survive in the wilderness. The skills are, piloting, land & air navigation, how to build a shelter & fire, what food can be eaten, etc.
            <br><br>Such skills are needed to join the U.S. Armed Forces. However, this is <em>NOT</em> a recruitment platform.

        <h1>The Mach Club Letter Of Intent/LOI</h1>
        <p>
            1.	PURPOSE. The purpose of this LOI is to outline and explain the details of The Mach Club, aka: TMC.
            <br><br>2.	CONCEPT. The Mach Club is an LDR that teaches survival in three areas: Air, Land, & Sea.  Each of which will be tested, to the max, at the competitions.
            <br><br>3.	DUES & PHYSICALS. Any JROTC/ROTC cadets participating in The Mach Club will have to pay a fee of $180 to join TMC. The fee covers the Windbreaker Jacket & your Squadron and Aircraft patch, as well as the activity fee. The fee must be paid before December.
            <br><br>4.	SQUADRONS. Cadets in Mach Club will be sorted into teams called squadrons. Squadrons will consist of up to a minimum of 12 cadets, which can be both male and female. The suggested amount is 18 cadets in one squadron.
            <br><br>5.	SURVIVAL. Survival is key, hence why we teach survival in the Air, on Land, and in the sea. The cadets will learn how to survive in any conditions (that we are allowed to simulate).
            <br>a.	AIR SURVIVAL/AVIATION. In air survival, the cadets will use simulators (DCS World | Digital Combat Simulator World) and fly fighter/attack jets. They will be taught dogfighting and Beyond-Visual Range Engagements. Air Survival will refine the cadet’s skills as a pilot, as well as their leadership, teamwork, and their skills in aviation (meteorology, flight, and more).
            <br>b.	LAND/GROUND SURVIVAL. Land survival will teach cadets how to survive in different environments, build shelters & fires, and how to do patrolling. They will learn how to survive in the wild, on their own and with their team.
            <br>c.	SEA/WATER SURVIVAL. Water Survival consists of cadets learning what to do in the middle of the ocean, how to stay afloat, what can be eaten, drinks, etc.
            <br><br><br>6.	COMPETITIONS. The Mach Club’s Fighter Attack Program, TOPGUN, is a competition held every Friday. It will test two teams, the School’s Elite team/Best Team, and a team of the instructors’ choice. The competition will test every squadron’s ability in all aspects, Air, Land, and Sea.
            <br><br>7.	PRACTICES. Practices will begin at 1530 (3:30pm) and end around 1800 (6:00pm) from Monday to Thursday starting November.
            <br><br>8.	CONDUCT. Cursing/Foul Language is never allowed, two warning will be issued, however, if a third time comes around, the cadet will be told to leave practice immediately and a call home will be made.
            <br><br>9.	A warning to all cadets partaking in The Mach Club, there will be unexpected situations that you will encounter. This will determine how well you can coordinate with your team and adapt to the new situation to complete your mission.
            <br><br>10.	We are what make The Mach Club, like an Iron Flower that never Dies, to become the Best of the Best, HOORAH.
